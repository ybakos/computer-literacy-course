# Survival Skills: A Computer Literacy Course

This repository is the result of using the [Morea Framework](http://morea-framework.github.io/) to generate materials for a modern "computer literacy" course, whose learning outcomes form the pre-requisites for a first course in computer programming.

## How to Use This

This repository is my own unbranded course design unaffiliated with any university program. To adopt this as your own course (e.g. CRCP 1001 Fall 2014) just fork this repository. You may want to refer to how [Morea](http://morea-framework.github.io/) sets up a separate directory for a gh-pages and master branches, so you don't have to switch branches frequently. I'm not sure about the best workflow for this yet.

## Motivation

I'm a little bored of teaching first year students about alt-tab / cmd-tab, and senior level students about navigating the filesystem from the console, among numerous other "survival skills" that every productive college student should know.

## Idea Dump

My dumping ground of ideas for outcomes, exercises, topics, modules, etc.

- Creating console alias shortcuts
- Console tab completion
- Colorizing git output
- Using git
- Motivations for version control
- Unzipping on windows
- Critical keyboard shortcuts
-- alt/cmd-tab
-- readline keybindings
--- ctrl-a, ctrl-e, ctrl-d, ctrl-k, ctrl-n, ctrl-p
-- tabbing and shift-tabbing between fields / UI elements
